# Bounding-Box Regression

This is code for the Bounding Box regression in keras with taking aeroplanes as the image. 
This is just one step less than YOLO (YOU only Look once) where we have to predict the object . Here I have taken already predicted object.

Run This code in [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) directly . 

Final.csv contains the coordinates 
DATA contains the 800 images of airplanes (CALTECH 101)
